/*
#Specification The input signal is represented as an array of integers. Several cases of regularities can be shortened.

A sequence of 2 or more identical numbers is shortened as number*count
A sequence of 3 or more consecutive numbers is shortened as first-last. This is true for both ascending and descending order
A sequence of 3 or more numbers with the same interval is shortened as first-last/interval. Note that the interval does NOT need a sign
Compression happens left to right
